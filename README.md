Tanzania has implemented a vitamin A distribution and deworming program to children in the country. The campaign, sponsored by Hellen Keller International, runs twice a year. This reduces child morbidity and mortality, and enhances the child survival rate. Distribution information is collected through tally sheets. The process is incredibly slow. Data doesn't come fast enough to make improvements for the next campaign. Users do not have smartphones and are very limited in internet access. Vitamin provides a simple and fast way to collect and aggregate vitamin distribution data. Health center volunteers send their data through SMS on their dumphones. The data gets reviewed at a district level, and is immediately available regionally and nationally. Data doesn't have to be collected at the end of campaigns, as organizers can monitor progress throughout the process. Vitamin is an integrated solution simple enough to be used by health center volunteers, and powerful enough for regional managers and supervisors.
